## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first web design
- Desktop Design
- Smoth scrolling
- Google Fonts - Style components

### What I learned

My Portfolio gave more understanding about using together Flexbox and CSS Grid, I recap over some of learnings while I was working through this project and a great way to reinforce mine own knowledge.

### Continued development

I'm still working on HTML, CSS, Flexbox and CSS Grid using new templates and working on it. I want to continue focusing on my future projects. I'm still not completely comfortable with all techniques I found useful that I want to refine and perfect.

## Acknowledgments

On this project I had great opportunity to learn more about HTML, CSS, Flexbox and CSS Grid. I'd like more contact with my teammates bootcamp. I understand everyone has no enogh time to share with me. To be alone this is not good. If someone needs my help I;ll be happy to help you.
